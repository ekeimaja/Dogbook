# Dogbook
My training project to migrate Django 2 and Angular 7. This is a Facebook-like portal for dog owners.

At the moment in November 2018 I've made some testing with Django, e.g. file uploading.

DEVLOG
-
**4.11.2018:** Created the Angular frontend with needed components.

**9.11.2018:** Made a test backend using ExpressJS. Check its branch to see it.

**10.11.2018:** Created the first version of layout, also moved it to own branch.

**13.11.2018:** Added getting data functionality with HTTP fetching with service. Currently the mock data comes from JSON file.

**08.12.2018:** I try to create workable file uploading system with Django on this weekend and also add it here. The problem has been that most of the tutorials for making it are complete **SHIT**.
